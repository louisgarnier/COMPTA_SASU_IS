# Known Errors & Investigation Methodology

## TL;DR
1. **Check the Error Registry below** — has this been solved before?
2. **Simplify before complexifying** — minimal fix first, test, then add complexity
3. **Compare with existing code** — copy working patterns, don't invent new ones
4. **Test after every change** — one change at a time, verify each
5. **If stuck** — STOP, restore to working state, restart simpler
6. **After fixing** — add an entry to the Error Registry immediately

## 🔍 Investigation Methodology

> **Read this BEFORE attempting to fix ANY error.**

### Fundamental Principles

#### 1. Simplify BEFORE Complexifying
- ❌ **BAD:** Add complex solutions
- ✅ **GOOD:** Create a minimal working version first

#### 2. Compare With Existing Code
- ❌ **BAD:** Create new code without looking at how it's done elsewhere
- ✅ **GOOD:** Find similar examples in the codebase, copy the working pattern

#### 3. Test Progressively
- ❌ **BAD:** Create everything at once, test only at the end
- ✅ **GOOD:** Create one thing at a time, test after each addition

#### 4. Isolate the Problem
- ❌ **BAD:** Modify several things at the same time
- ✅ **GOOD:** Test if the problem existed before your changes

#### 5. Don't Break the Application
- ❌ **BAD:** Keep modifying even if the app no longer works
- ✅ **GOOD:** Restore immediately if the app is broken

### Checklist Before Modifying Code
- [ ] I've read the existing code to understand the pattern
- [ ] I've found similar examples in the codebase
- [ ] I will create a minimal version first
- [ ] I will test after each modification
- [ ] I know how to restore if it breaks
- [ ] I will NOT add unnecessary complexity
